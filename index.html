        <h3>The story</h3>

        <p id="paragraphe1">Once upon a time there was a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byQrdnq7_H0&ab_channel=Wiara" title="The Story of the Chinese Farmer on video">Chinese farmer</a> whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said, <blockquote class="villager">“We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.”</blockquote> The farmer said, <blockquote class="farmer">“<strong>Maybe</strong>.”</blockquote> The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, <blockquote class="villager">“Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!”</blockquote> The farmer again said, <blockquote class="farmer">“<strong>Maybe</strong>.”</blockquote></p> 

        <p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, <blockquote class="villager">“Oh dear, that’s too <em class="bad">bad</em>,”</blockquote> and the farmer responded, <blockquote class="farmer">“<strong>Maybe</strong>.”</blockquote> The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, <blockquote class="villager">“Isn’t that great!”</blockquote> Again, he said, <blockquote class="farmer">“<strong>Maybe</strong>.”</blockquote></p>

        <blockquote>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <em class="good">good</em> or <em class="bad">bad</em> — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.<br><br><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Watts" title="Alan Watts">Alan Watts</a></blockquote>

        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
        <p><em class="good">Good</em> and <em class="bad">Bad</em> are just one perspective. Bananas are good for monkeys, but monkeys are not good for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...</p>
